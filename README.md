# Checksums and Metadata Tools

This is a collection of command line tools. Several python scripts perform the following tasks: <br>
* Generate MD5 checksums for files <br>
* Verify file integrity across multiple locations<br>
* Extract metadata from files <br>

The tools were built to automate and streamline parts of my former job as a museum collections manager. They can be used for the documentation and preservation of video artwork files, and other born digital artworks/artifacts.

All scripts run in the Mac terminal.
